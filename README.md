# ü§ñ Artificial Intelligence Repository  

Welcome to the Artificial Intelligence repository! This project explores AI-driven problem-solving techniques, including **Genetic Algorithms** for optimization and **Alpha-Beta Pruning** for game strategy. Each implementation demonstrates key AI concepts in action.  

## üöÄ Project Overview  

This repository includes AI-powered solutions to complex problems:  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Knapsack Problem ‚Äì Genetic Algorithm (Roulette Wheel Selection)  
- **Filename:** `knapsack_roulette.py`  
- **Concept:** Implements a Genetic Algorithm with **Roulette Wheel Selection** to optimize the **0/1 Knapsack Problem**.  
- **How it Works:**  
  - Uses **chromosome representation** for items in the knapsack.  
  - Applies **mutation and crossover** to generate better solutions.  
  - **Roulette Wheel Selection** ensures probabilistic choice of fitter solutions.  
- **Additional File:** `test.txt` ‚Äì Contains sample knapsack items for testing the algorithm.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Tic-Tac-Toe ‚Äì Alpha-Beta Pruning (Unbeatable AI)  
- **Filename:** `Tic Tac Toe.py`  
- **Concept:** Implements **Alpha-Beta Pruning**, making AI **invincible** in Tic-Tac-Toe.  
- **How it Works:**  
  - Uses **Minimax Algorithm** with **Alpha-Beta Pruning** to optimize decision-making.  
  - Always plays the **best move**, making AI impossible to defeat.  
  - **Efficient pruning** reduces computational complexity, making the game run faster.
